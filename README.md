# Capturing audio and passing it over a BT to the sink - using win32 API

Project abandoned I don't need the use case anymore, and I can't stand looking at WinAPI so not even considering using it. What is working:
* Capturing audio from PC
* Packing it to the OPUS container, can be played later by music player
* Discovering and pairing with BT clients

Left for reference (on how to not write APIs).
